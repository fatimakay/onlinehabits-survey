# Online Habits and Entertainment Preferences Survey
A survey conducted as part of the coursework for Spiced Academy.

##Purpose 
To get an overview of how data collection and analysis works, and how measures of central tendencies can be calculated. 

##Execution
- We prepared an online questionnaire using Google Forms, which included a combination of categorical and numerical data types. The questions were related to the social media apps and streaming services most preferred by the class and the time spent on various platforms. 
- The questionnaire was then distributed among the Minty Floaties.
- 12 responses were collected anonymously.
- Exporting the received data to Google Sheets, we then generated the appropriate graphs for the responses and calculated the mean, variance, and standard deviations of the numerical data. 
- These findings were then presented to the class where we discussed possible insights that could be deduced from the data.
